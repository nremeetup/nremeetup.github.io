      <description>Confessions and network reliability engineering, an interesting mix! Alas, Confessions was the name of the venue that hosted the second NRE Meetup. Thanks to everyone that came along and took part in the great discussions.
We spoke at length about Terraform, standardisation of terminology and NRE Labs.
Takeaways from this session were:
 Do not book these events the day before a national holiday NRE is a hot topic, with organisations and individuals looking to move forwards with reliabilty at the core Terraform is an interesting proposition for networking  Super short write-up but thanks again to everyone that came along!</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;welcome-to-the-nre-meetup-site&#34;&gt;Welcome to the NRE Meetup site!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the NRE Meetup?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a group of people who gather together to discuss, debate and chew on network engineering, automation and orchestration matters. We drink stuff, eat food and share content for the greater good of our abused community.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
